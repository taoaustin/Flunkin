# Friday Night Tryin my best to code this stuff (name to be determined lol)

Hey all! This is really just my attempts as someone who likes rhythm games to add some features that I would personally enjoy having. I think they'll mainly be Quality of Life chances, but also just any features to change things up too.

- Added a save/restart point feature for songs in Freeplay Mode, useful to drill out any of those tougher sections, for now it's 'O' to set a savepoint, and 'P' to restart from that point. (still working out some bugs and stuff)
- Added Fading notes options in pause menu. LEFT and RIGHT to change true/false, Enter to select. Notes will start to fade away into the ether as they approach the receptors

Removed APIStuff.hx fom gitignore, just for easier compiling if anyone decides to download

__TO DO/FIX__
- <s>Fix alignment of incoming notes after a restart from save point</s>
- <s>Only allow feature to work in FreePlay mode.</s>
- Hold 'O' to unset, flash RED, restart will set you back to beginning
- Fix health decreasing when reseting, (reset score maybe)
- reset, notes come in inconsistent times :( (think it has to do w/ the current beat/section i'm in before i reset)
- Song json formatting, why are bpm, sections, notes repeated at the end of the file? + sections=0 in "song" while sections = correct# outside of songs???

__Plans/Thins to consider__
- Fade-in/out (in prog.) (osu!mania)
- Variable scroll speed
- Note timing bar
- Redo in Kade-Engine???
- Suggestions are welcome!

## Build instructions

THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR COMPILING THE GAME'S SOURCE CODE!!!

IF YOU WANT TO JUST DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL AND PLAY THE GAME NORMALLY, GO TO ITCH.IO TO DOWNLOAD THE GAME FOR PC, MAC, AND LINUX!!

https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin

IF YOU WANT TO COMPILE THE GAME YOURSELF, CONTINUE READING!!!

### Installing the Required Programs

First, you need to install Haxe and HaxeFlixel. I'm too lazy to write and keep updated with that setup (which is pretty simple). 
1. [Install Haxe 4.1.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.1.5/) (Download 4.1.5 instead of 4.2.0 because 4.2.0 is broken and is not working with gits properly...)
2. [Install HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/) after downloading Haxe

Other installations you'd need are the additional libraries, a fully updated list will be in `Project.xml` in the project root. Currently, these are all of the things you need to install:
```
flixel
flixel-addons
flixel-ui
hscript
newgrounds
```
So for each of those type `haxelib install [library]` so shit like `haxelib install newgrounds`

You'll also need to install a couple things that involve Gits. To do this, you need to do a few things first.
1. Download [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Works for Windows, Mac, and Linux, just select your build.
2. Follow instructions to install the application properly.
3. Run `haxelib git polymod https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod.git` to install Polymod.
4. Run `haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc` to install Discord RPC.

You should have everything ready for compiling the game! Follow the guide below to continue!

At the moment, you can optionally fix the transition bug in songs with zoomed-out cameras.
- Run `haxelib git flixel-addons https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-addons` in the terminal/command-prompt.

### Ignored files

I gitignore the API keys for the game so that no one can nab them and post fake high scores on the leaderboards. But because of that the game
doesn't compile without it.

Just make a file in `/source` and call it `APIStuff.hx`, and copy & paste this into it

```haxe
package;

class APIStuff
{
	public static var API:String = "";
	public static var EncKey:String = "";
}

```

and you should be good to go there.

### Compiling game

Once you have all those installed, it's pretty easy to compile the game. You just need to run 'lime test html5 -debug' in the root of the project to build and run the HTML5 version. (command prompt navigation guide can be found here: [https://ninjamuffin99.newgrounds.com/news/post/1090480](https://ninjamuffin99.newgrounds.com/news/post/1090480))
To run it from your desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) it can be a bit more involved. For Linux, you only need to open a terminal in the project directory and run 'lime test linux -debug' and then run the executable file in export/release/linux/bin. For Windows, you need to install Visual Studio Community 2019. While installing VSC, don't click on any of the options to install workloads. Instead, go to the individual components tab and choose the following:
* MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools
* Windows SDK (10.0.17763.0)

Once that is done you can open up a command line in the project's directory and run `lime test windows -debug`. Once that command finishes (it takes forever even on a higher end PC), you can run FNF from the .exe file under export\release\windows\bin
As for Mac, 'lime test mac -debug' should work, if not the internet surely has a guide on how to compile Haxe stuff for Mac.
